			<p>We LGBT will be deprecated in the coming weeks. We LGBT was a fun extension showing how far you'd have to go to step away from the support of companies by changing their logos to the ones they used around the U.S. Supreme Court Case on June 26, 2013, and changing the icon based off of statements and the signing of the amicus brief for said court case. The world has come a long way in terms of LGBT support from U.S. companies and organizations since then, negative companies are easier to spot or evolved to reflect a positive stance. We LGBT started to become a hard-to-manage index of the ever growing amount of large companies that support LGBT equality and the issue is more complex than we could possibly tackle given that the extension was a side project.</p>
			<p>As for going forward, more in-depth evaluations of companies as employers are available from <a href="https://www.hrc.org/" target="_blank">Human Rights Campaign</a> as well as news and education materials with many more resources being available elsewhere on the internet. For those passionate about LGBT rights, we suggest taking action against injustices in your community and work whenever possible and being a part of nationwide movements to change the world for the better. The extension will continue to work as normal using a backup file of the internal data so We LGBT should continue it's current state as long as you have the extension installed. On May 21, 2017, the source code will be moved and the extension will be unpublished from the Chrome Web Store.</p>
